# SalesForecasting-MultiModels 📊

## Project Objective 🎯
The goal of this project was to apply various quantitative methods, (i.e. Time Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast the sales of the products available in the dataset.

## Key Steps 🔍
1. **Perform Time Series Analysis:** Understand the data and trends.
2. **Use Multiple Forecasting Models:** Apply different models on the train dataset.
3. **Select the Best Model:** Run the test data with the best-performing model.

## Models Covered 🧩
- **Seasonal Naive Model**
- **Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)**
- **ARIMA Model and Seasonal ARIMA Models**
- **Linear Regression Model**

## Conclusion 📈
We considered different time-series models as well as a regression model for time series forecasting. From our results, the linear regression model outperformed the other time-series models. For this dataset, the regression model was more effective due to the highly seasonal and linear trend patterns in the historical data.
